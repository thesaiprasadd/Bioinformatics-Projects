# Bioinformatics-Projects
1. SpA (Spondyloarthritis) Gene Analysis Project
Identified and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Spondyloarthritis using GEO dataset GSE41038, followed by network construction and hub gene detection to uncover key molecular targets.

2. PTEN Inhibition & CNS Regeneration Project
Explored PTEN gene inhibition as a strategy for central nervous system regeneration by studying its role in neuron growth and repair pathways, highlighting therapeutic potential in spinal cord injuries.
