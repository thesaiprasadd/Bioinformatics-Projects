Project 1: Studied PTEN gene inhibition to promote CNS regeneration using gene expression data and docking of potential inhibitors targeting neural repair pathways.  
Project 2: Analyzed DEGs in ankylosing spondylitis via GEO2R, identified hub genes, and performed docking to explore protein interactions.
